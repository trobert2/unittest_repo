unittest_repo
=============

repository for playing with mox and unittesting

You just need to write tests for the code you find in folder 'code' (second.py only, that is the level you are testing)

you need mox and nosetests installed on your machine for this

this will help you get familiar with git also, just fork your repository, create a branch, then clone it to your working area

this way you can do commits and push to your own repo in the cloud

When you are finished, do a pull request to my original repo. 

SQUASH your commits! 

This is a workflow you need to get familiar with.
